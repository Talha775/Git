i was about to buy a whole new ice maker till i started researching the parts in more detail  certainly you need to know what failed on the ice maker  in my case i had fairly high confidence the motor was failing would try and run but clicked and eventually give up  three screws later and about  minutes the bad one was out and the new one was in  i had ice going in about an hour or so and has been working great for over a month now  you can find many youtube videos showing how to change it out if you need a confidence boost  there is also a repairclinic website that has some great instructional stuff they sell parts too so i feel bad to only use them for the info though if i was uncertain on the parts i would consider the higher price due to the simple and liberal return policy,60,positive,positive

perfect match for original part super easy fix one thing i will suggestif you are buying this because your filter wont lock into the housing check it before ordering new the four tabs shown in the above photo of tge back of the part are retaining clips that hold the back to the front of the part on my part the tabs had disengaged from the slots and thus the fitting of the filter would not latch in once i got those aligned and clicked into place the filter locked in just fine ill keep the part in case this happens again it is indeed an easy day fix,60,positive,positive

when our ice maker stopped working lots of grinding noises and no ice we decided we needed to act after the basic online troubleshooting the obvious became clear  it was brokebr more online research showed there were some replacements out there i chose the amazon one for both price reasonable and security while i was fairly sure this was the one we needed with amazon i felt i had an option if something was wrongbr turns out it was fairly easy to replace though there was a plastic part that had to be trimmed that was not in the instructions but looking at the old one and new one it became clear once installed it has worked great,60,positive,positive

this unit has a highpitched noise that is constant when using the spin cycle unit very annoying did i mention that it didnt come with instructions,60,positive,positive
listed as replacement part for electrolux refrigerator but buyer bewarebr br it did not pair with my electrolux in  very important waysbr the sluice way that catches and channels the water from the water source to the new ice maker is very small compared to the original as a result the water collector does not sit under the water supply hose water would just pour into the freezer compartmentbr i had to take apart the old ice maker and the new icemaker and swap parts the same for the power cords  i had to disassemble the old icemaker and salvagereuse the old cord the new was  foot too short  it took  hour of canabilization to get the new icemaker to mate with the freezer it was stated to be a replacement for  so unless you are prepared to get creative steer clear as the new icemaker wont work without a water or power supply,60,positive,positive

bought this icemaker on  and today it is doa and i dont know what is wrong with it although there does not appear to be any movement of the motor and the unit does not get cold there is an icon with an  inside a triangle and a number  idk what that means cleaning button does not work manual does not address the icon at all this sucks i loved the ice it made i am an ice eater and it makes the ice just the right consistency for chewing and the cubes are just the right size thats why i gave it a  but i feel it should have lasted longer and there should be something telling me what is wrong with it guess i will have to throw it away and start over but i wont buy this brand again,60,positive,negative

i normally buy these at walmart but for the past few months they havent had any so i believe they discontinued them so when i saw the price of these versus how many you get i thought it was a fantastic bargain when they arrived they were super thin i didnt believe that what i got was the amount that i ordered but after counting them it was they are just so thin its almost like putting tissue paper under your burners they still serve their purpose by keeping the burner plates clean but i wish they were a little bit more sturdy,60,positive,positive

great price,60,positive,positive

love the size and features but like everyone else after just  years the evaporator coils freeze over all the time ice builds up water pools under the inside of my fridge and then spills to the outside and ruined my wood floor  samsung continues to design fridges year after year with the same design flaw  you cant even review this product on theit website because its that bad   bucks for the drain everyone learn do not buy samsung  i will never buy another samsung product again,60,positive,negative

just installed todaybr br i would not buy it again  the downdraft sucks away the heat so that the food being cooked takes forever to cook  a small  quart pot of soup was still lukewarm after five minutes on high heat with the downdraft turned on  i finally had to turn off the downdraft to get it to come to a boilbr br and  the downdraft only works well on the two back burners  i would not use the downdraft except that it must be turned on to protect the kitchen from carbon monoxide fumes emitted by the burnersbr br the heat element is too far from the bottom of the pot and the burners do not emit enough flame for quick heatingbr br very poor design,60,positive,negative
seems nice but husband hasnt used it yet,60,positive,positive
listing says exact replacement not true pay special attention to the orientation of the windings and the electrical connectionsbr br had an older kenmore sidebyside somebody had done us a great service by removing the serial number sticker so i pulled the old at motor see pictures has the original part number  look for a motor with that number in cross reference in came up with this listing unfortunately when i received the part it was basically in there image everything that was on the right side of regionally is on the left side the wiring is not long enough absolute waste of time,60,positive,negative
works great easy set up,60,positive,positive
wow i am impressed the tube that came with my cold coffee kit was a lot thinner and lighter than this one yet i was happy with it at the time but after less than a year the rim around the top began to separate from the mesh after reading numerous reviews for a replacement i settled on this one and boy what a surprise this tube is very sturdy and has a heftier feel to it the mesh is finer which means very little ground seep out of it i can see this one lasting for a long time oh and it is easy to rinse out after dumping the used grounds out,60,positive,positive

it installed easy enough but needed a modification to function properly the tab on the lid wouldnt activate the switch it should click when switching and that wasnt happening some doublesided tape to hold a plastic pad on the switch allowed the tab to press the switch far enough and the switch would activate the circuit it was well worth the savings though compared to the much higher cost of an oem switch,60,positive,positive

ive been using my icemaker weekly for  months i run it for a few hours to make enough ice for me for one week i have discovered that using refrigerated water helps make the first batch as firm as the last batch so cubes dont form one giant clump once i move them to the freezer,60,positive,positive

weve had this dishwasher for over a year now and it has been spectacular i love not having to hand wash the dishes i have had problems when using jet dry rinse agent it creates tons of suds but that could be due to our water i use lemishine now with no sudsing problems also my large dinner plates dont fit upright i have to put them in on a slant being careful not to block the detergent dispenser those are the only two issues ive had and they were both easily fixed the dishwasher fits perfectly on the counter top near the sink the water hoses are lonh enough if you dont want to put it directly next to the sink i love this dishwasher its perfect for our apartment i highly recommend it,60,positive,positive

got this so my bf knows when to not leave his dishes in the sink works  of the time,60,positive,positive
great bang for my bucks,60,positive,positive
packaged nicely and it was producing ice within about  minutes initially the cubes were thin and actually were great for icechewing lovers like me but they were a bit too thin for chilling drinks as they would melt quickly overnight the basket filled up and now it seems not only are the cubes thicker but like other reviewers they dont seem to change in size even with setting adjustments its okay thoughwe want cubes for our drinks purchase to use in our outdoor kitchen it says its not suited for outdoor use but our area is fully covered and protected we will only be using it for parties and clearly it will take hours to produce enough ice for larger groups but with advanced planning it will be convenient to have rather than always having to buy and lug bags of ice our area is detached from the house and several hundred feet away so this will certainly be handy definitely recommend if you have a wet bar game room or area where you might enjoy extra ice it will take up some space though,60,positive,positive
came quickly easy to use,60,positive,positive
what can i say   i love my coffee even more knowing the water is filtered  the price was great and they arrived promptly,60,positive,positive
this is a very well made washer  it does wash the clothes but no better than putting them in a sink and agitating by hand  it is handy for presoaking hand washables or items you dont want in the regular laundry  ill probably keep it in the basement for emergencies but its not really something that ill use often  it did serve its purpose and again is very well made,60,positive,positive
we saved a lot of money by replacing the control board ourselves fridge was fixed in a jiffy,60,positive,positive

we replaced our kitchen appliances last month with stainless steel units but my wife was still happy with her  yo ge gas cooktop so we kept that but the original cream colored knobs were getting very worn  found these on amazon and they are a perfect fit for the originals and add a bit of stainless steel look to the cooktop  they were an exact fit pull the old ones off and put the new ones on  i had no problems that many had with ill fitting or blemished knobs  just make sure you get the right onesthis model has a longer column another model has no column so make sure how your current knobs are constructed  very happy with these replacement knobs,60,positive,positive

these would be great but they dont stay in because they are missing the plastic piece that keeps it in place in the keurig  it is the piece at the top where the arrow is,60,positive,negative
easy to install and seems to work well,60,positive,positive
perfect,60,positive,positive

this after high end market cap worked perfectly to replace a broken one in the refrigerator it works as well as the original,60,positive,positive
ive tried a number of different filters but this is the best design i have found tight seal and no leaks i like the keurig coffee maker for the ease of use and single cup im single as i drink just one cup at a time i dont like adding all the little plastic cups to our environment i have purchased a number of different reusable filters and had one that was my favorite this is very close to that design when i purchased this  pack i realized it was so handy to have multiples so i purchased a second  pack after using i let them sit overnight and dry so they are easy to empty of grounds by simply knocking on the inside of my trashcan it takes barely a rinse to clean of water to clean completely and then reuse occasionally i wash with soap and water but its not often necessary i love this product,60,positive,positive
product arrived quickly after half a dozen uses it has melted the bottom of my dishwasher,60,positive,positive
replaced defective part in my refrigerator it works great to fix issue with no ice due to no water went through ice maker,60,positive,positive

we used the magvent v while remodeling for whatever reason our vent had been placed in the floor pier and beam about  inches from the wall  this ended up being one of the easiest parts of our project,60,positive,positive

lost the last dozen of these i bought wanted a smaller quantity to keep and use before i lose the packagei will purchase againand againbr br thanks,60,positive,positive
it is the quietest dishwasher ive ever owned however i think we sacrificed an effective wash to have this quiet is leaves a film on the dishes and does not effectively wash away food particles we try to wash most food off of our dishes prior to placing them in the dishwasher and use the heavy load cycle but it still does not remove grease and leaves dried particles on our dishes i would estimate that  of our dishes must be hand washed or prewashed in the dishwasher to be truly clean save your   buy another dishwasher i was so excited thinking i would have a top of the line dishwasher for my new kitchen but i seriously regret this purchase,60,positive,positive
really great  works perfectly with my keurig elite  very easy to fill and tastes just like the keurig capsules i purchase when using the same coffee flavour  i do however use paper filters with these cups to ensure there are no grounds or sediment in my coffee,60,positive,positive
ice maker seems to be working well but upon unpacking i discovered a baseball sized dent in the front panel which is disappointing,60,positive,positive
replaced the coupler on my old ultimate care ii washing machine works great,60,positive,positive
just got this microwave todaywhich was quite fast it arrived unscathed despite the dents and holes in the outside packaging material it looks good although the same basic box they all are and i do like the glossy black on the doors thus far it seems to do what it is supposed to do however it is far less easy to use and significantly less well engineereddesigned than the almost  year old sharp it replaces the fact that its many times louder than my old sharp is most annoying and inexcusable additionally unlike the ancient sharp used as my reference it does not allow one to disable the tones it emits when one uses the keypad or when the appliance alerts one that it has completed the job at hand and from my vantage those tones are overly loud as well the sharp also basically had all the features this one has except the inverter defrost and was much more intuitive to use and overall required fewer steps to accomplish the same results in summary i suspect that this will function quite adequately for me and i will get used to its noisy operations however i also expect that i will not keep it for its full life ie not anywhere near as long as the sharp and will almost certainly go back to a product made by sharp,60,positive,positive
the best machine,60,positive,positive
i originally bought this for camping but since covid hit and we dont do communal coffee makers at work ive been using it daily easy to use great tasting coffee and easy to clean,60,positive,positive

was scared when i read all the reviews about the leaks but decided i would order one to try it out installed without any problems and have had it on for about  hours with no leaks however it does appear that it does not fit as nicely as my older filter kinda hangs down like it doesnt have the proper support which kinda scares me a little for a potential future leaks,60,positive,positive

im pretty good at fixing things but had never had a frontloader dryer apart before  i couldnt find an internet video on the exact model i have but got enough guidance from likemodels that i was able to disassemble replace parts reassemble and successfully have it running again  was it easy  no but it wasnt awful and i took my time and had little frustration  the part number stamped on the belt wasnt the same as the number in the ad i ordered from but i compared the new to the old and it was obvious there wouldnt be a problem  i replaced worn rollers but since i had it apart it seemed like it would be prudent to put in a new belt while it was apart,60,positive,positive

bought this hearing great recommendations for it however it is terrible the product itself works great however the drain pipe and cord arent long enough so its hassle to set up you need to make sure you have access to plug in the cord and have it placed somewhere where the drain pipe can flush out without flooding a room its just too much when going to and from the laundromat is just as much work if not less work this machine was chaotic,60,positive,positive

arrived in good condition the gas port points directly to the back and the cooktop is not deep enough to clear the countertop had to put a  deg fitting in and it required flexing things quite a bit the fitting is too close to the bottom to swing the  to put it on  if you used one of the adaptors that come with it you will have your gas port pointing directly against the counter so the line will have to make a sharp  and even then you cant fit the top back in the hole this cooktop is really designed to sit on top not down in the countertop i did get the  degree elbow to screw on but it was not easy had to continuously bend the sheet metal and flex the pipe to get it on,60,positive,negative

poor design imho  freeze grid is mounted vertically so the water runs down the grid constantly as the ice forms then when the ice melts enough to leave the grid the cubes come out together cold and wet and reform a sheet of cubes and falls into the basket  you then need to break the sheet of cubes with the scoop i returned mine,60,positive,positive
i read the negative reviews and should have listened but trying to save money like we all do i went ahead and tried it  this is a terrible product  when you buy a relay it should not rattle like this one did out of the box  i installed it to see if it would even work and it did but i pulled it back off after an hour to see what was smelling like burnt plastic  you guessed it  my new relay was now stinking the place up with that nasty burnt electronics smell  the compressor on my fridge pulls  amps on startup and then reduces to  amp during run time  this is a fire hazard people with this start relay  if you want a fire behind your refrigerator or to make a simple problem and fix worse then buy this product  i am betting you dont  the capacitor may be worth the price as an oem capacitor for my refrigerator is   the relay is total trash  if you are buying this for the relay  just get oem or risk a fire  i cant be more clear than that  this relay i bought was for a whirlpool refrigerator just for reference  it fit correctly but the quality is not even worthy of a star  now i have to drive  miles just to drop it off at the ups store  amazon one day delivery is also a joke  at least in my area  if you cant get it here on time within one day just say so  i would understand that  promising something you cant deliver  well most people dont appreciate that  i dont  tldr  this product is terrible  do not buy  thank you for reading,60,positive,negative

clear directions installed with no leaksbr br you will have to pull the diswasher out from the wall and tip it forward to install this part,60,positive,positive
i was given this item as a gift but feel inclined to post a review here  the longer you read this the more you will believe that i actually have one and wont be deterred by not having the verified tag at the topbr i definitely went through some growing pains with this unit the foaming problems which are prevalent with bad reviews are caused by a number of factors  some of those factors are uncontrollable by the end useryoume as in some kegs just fail pressure  i found myself fiddling with hose length temperature pressure leveling tightness of connections etc  i even went on and replaced the stock  tubing with a  tubing and fixtures set thinking that would solve my issues  it actually helped but only for a type of beer that has a specific gravity  yeah another factor you have to deal withbr bottom line is that you can find the perfect pour but theres a learning curve even for the most experienced person  right now my fat tire is pouring perfectly at about  degree no complaints,60,positive,positive

if you were like me you searched for a replacement valve for your furnace humidifier and became confused by the large selection and wide range of prices  dont be confused by a specific brand or the different applications that they list  as long as fittings look like the ones one your valve this one will work for you  every furnace valve works on standard furnace power which is universal in north america  this is a simple repair that anyone with basic wiring skills can do  the voltage involved cannot harm you  just turn off the water valve  undo your fitting cut your wires and remove the old valve  splice the new wires onto the old ones no positive or negative since its ac screw the new valve back into position screw the water lines back on follow the arrows for flow direction and turn your water back on  you did the job for  and it only took about  minutes,60,positive,positive

filters work fine  noticed a couple of interesting differences from the brand name filters  these filters seem to be fluffier than the brand name ones i assume being unbleached may make them thicker  so they take up more room in the filter holder  not a big deal  also perhaps because of different construction they dont seem to stick together as much as the brand name filters  nice difference  these filters appear to be same price as brand name filters so i guess its just a matter of personal preference  so far im leaning to these over the brand name filters,60,positive,positive
seems to do what it is supposed to do  the water tastes good,60,positive,positive
love this at the lake for extra ice,60,positive,positive

we have an lg refrigerator and were paying about  for one water filter at lowes i would put off buying one until water started tasting bad because i hated paying that much so decided to go on line and see if i could find them cheaper and found the waterdrop filters on amazon  filters for a lot less than we were paying for one i read reviews some were positive and some not so good but decided to take a chance and order received filters pretty fast looked just like the old one that we took out easy to install and i havent noticed any leaks you have to run quite a bit of water thru before you start drinking it but had to do that with expensive one too so far im pleased with the product water tastes good and i drink a lot of water cant tell any difference in these filters and  ones,60,positive,positive

i purchased this filter although apprehensively and have been totally happy with it  i use it with lavazza italian fine ground coffee and am happy to say that the flavor is much better than with paper filters  i was worried about grounds falling through the filter holes and am happy to report that the holes are miniscule it almost looks like there arent any holes but a solid sheet of stainless  of course there is a little dust in the bottom of the cup but nothing to complain about  im very happy with this purchase,60,positive,positive
weve had this range for about  years now my wife really likes it and she loves to cook but you would think that for a  cooking stove the burner knobs would be better than they are ive just ordered two of the power boil knobs because they cracked and would not work anymore two knobs cost us  including tax i hope they fit when they get here because i guess they are an aftermarket product now were stuck with cooking on the smaller burners until the new knobs get here we purchased the ge cafe because we liked the looks and it had excellent ratings at that time not sure i would buy it again unless ge made some changes,60,positive,negative
works terribly dont recommend at all  easily overspills if too much coffee loadedjust too touchy to get that right with the end result of mucho grains in your cup of joe  also inconvenient as it necessitates removal of the basket quotreceivorquot in the mother machine to allow this to fit into  way too much going on here to be anywhere approaching quotconveniencequot,60,positive,positive
can not work between the counter  and stove i  was so eager to get it oh thats life i order quite often because of my mobility,60,positive,positive

convenient but  doesnt look durable,60,positive,positive
i bought the same springs from somebody else on amazon at a cheaper price  dont waste your time or money  the other spring was too wimpy to do the job  this one is of much higher quality and worked properly as soon as i installed it  cheaper is not necessarily less expensive when you just have to turn around and order the one that will actually do the job anyway,60,positive,positive
fixed the dreaded ul issue saved a ton of money great step by step video on youtube not sure it even took ten minutes,60,positive,positive
they were shorter than i thought they were but they fit fine,60,positive,positive
i did quite a bit of research on freestanding ice makers before buying this one  i found that most were not actually freezers meaning that even though they made ice they did not maintain a freezing temperature for storing the ice  this didnt work for my circumstances  i needed the unit to make and store ice insufficient quantities for family gatherings for  to  people especially in the hot summer time  simply put the uline ice maker does the job  this purchase was my second uline ice maker  we own a vacation rental property on a lake  the house sleeps  to  people and stays rented all summer  the ice requirements are substantially beyond what a normal refrigeratorfreezer will produce  the first uline unit i purchased is still working strong after two years in a demanding rental environment  based on this success i recently purchase a second unit for my home  one nice feature is that it does not require a drain line  this made the installation about as easy as could be expected  it just so happened that on the day my home unit arrived my kitchen appliance repair man was working on my refrigerator  when he saw the uline ice maker being delivered he commented that the uline ice makers were his favorite  he said that they work well and do not require his repair services nearly as often as some of the other brands  this unit gets my wholehearted recommendation,60,positive,positive
size is great,60,positive,positive
came quickly and fit perfectly,60,positive,positive
excelente,60,positive,positive
i feel these filters are overpriced but at least amazon has made it easier to get them replaced,60,positive,positive

i stopped a local appliance repairman on the street a while back and asked him face to face if he was to buy a top loading washer and dryer what brand would he buy he answered hed buy a speed queen set just an old school washer and dryer turn the knobs no fancy electronics just analog timers no locking lids you choose the water levels american made just what we wanted he was right to suggest this set for me,60,positive,positive
unless you like grinds in your coffee you will still need to use a paper filter also the lids are very loose making it awkward to handle,60,positive,positive

we have had this range hood installed for over two years now its quiet effective and relatively easy to keep clean its nice that the filter mesh fits into the dishwasherbr br the only downsides so far have been a couple of quality issues the light cover cracked when we installed it even though we were careful not to overtighten the screw the little red plastic cover for the poweron indicator has popped off a couple of times when ive reached to turn off the fan without looking so user error and finally the downdraft protection recently came loose im not sure why the plastic gave up if it was an installation problem or a quality issue we pulled it out and havent replaced it because were not sure how much we have to take apart to do the work we had a contractor install it for usbr br were still happy with the way the range hood looks and it performs pretty well for something that is hundreds of dollars cheaper than anything else of a similar style,60,positive,positive
had to return but it appears to be a solid product,60,positive,negative
really great filters untreated and well packed easy to use,60,positive,positive
great filters reasonably priced,60,positive,positive
nice item but its not packaged appropriately its shipped rolled in a tube okay thats well and fine but they wrapped two rubber bands tightly around it one each end so it marscreases the product luckily our image is more dark which makes it less notable i hate returning an item so we will live with it just highly disappointed there was no reason for the rubber bands,60,positive,positive
excellent,60,positive,positive
this is a great company to work with  i had questions about the weight the product would hold and was taken care of immediately  this is not a good stand for extralarge appliances but perfect for standard size ones  easy to put together too,60,positive,positive
stock oem part works like a charm just the way it is supposed too,60,positive,positive
works really well  but the installation instructions are horrible and actually dont explain the process well i had to take a different approach  if it were not for the instructions i would have given  stars,60,positive,positive
mine broke on my samsung dryer easy to replace and so far it works great only used a couple times but no issues so far,60,positive,positive
did not want to take a chance on a cheaper replacement unit paid the extra cost for an oem part so hopefully it will last as long as the original,60,positive,positive
a lot to pay for the wall bracket but it works worth noting is that after you mount the bracket to the wall the blaster wouldnt fit onto it i was about to pull the bracket off the wall and install a  thick shim plate when i realized the bracket could be bent by hand to allow the air force blaster to seat on it properly,60,positive,positive
water tastes awful now i will have to buy another filter at a higher cost and more shipping charges,60,positive,positive
the valve works great,60,positive,positive

this is a very nice stainless steel piece works as it should as long as your portafilter measures mm it will fit inside the breville bambinobambino plus and barista express espresso machines will also fit bottomless and bottomed portafiltersbr it actually fits nicely inside the bambino plus with the oem portafilter the one comes with the machine straight from the box i would however recommend getting a non pressurized basket like this one as an extra one,60,positive,positive
watch a youtube video on installation and youll be fine unplug the fridge first after you take out the ice tray button on the top remove the small cover for the wiring remove the cover and unplug the unit first plug then theres only one screw holding a tray for the ice machine bend the metal ushape rod down a bit about  inchs and you will see how the unit comes out remove any built up ice carefully and just slide this one right in bend the ushape rod back up best you can and then close the tray with the one screw provided plug in the unit and reattach the wire cover slide the ice tray back in and plug in the fridge you should have ice within hrs good luck,60,positive,positive
i read the reviews i dont agree with them this unit makes very small thimblesized ice cubes that are white likely due to air in them ice cubes should be clear not white in color each tray dump about  minutes make a very small amount of ice dont confuse this with your ice maker at home it takes quite a lot of time to fill up the little basket and by the time that happens its melting together my machine also arrived with a big scratch on the black plastic lid im going to buy a residential ice maker that fits in undercabinet these imo are real ice makers,60,positive,positive
a repair technician told me that he uses these in place of the overpriced oem versions  my oven igniter was priced at   this worked great and saved me quite a bit of money it looked identical to the original other than having the protective shield which i left in place as it didnt interfere with anything,60,positive,positive
we only recently installed the water pad and found it was simple to do so  as far as function we are not able to assess because we do not use the humidifier in the warmer months  because of the ease of installing im certainly pleased we changed it ourselves rather than pay a service person to do it  i gave the rating a four star because i simply couldnt bring myself to say i love a water filter,60,positive,positive
good quality and construction,60,positive,positive
this range has a major design flaw in the front panel any amount of moisture will short out the oven controls this has happened to us at least once a year for all three years that weve owned it its a  fix every time and the warranty is almost upsowere looking for a new range when it does work it is inconsistent at best both ovens inexplicably run up to  degrees hot or cold at any given time even fluctuating from one to the other during the baking of a single batch of cookies however the top oven more typically runs cold and cant get over  degrees according to my oven thermometer the low burner for simmering actually does pretty well and earns this range the single lone star otherwise it would get zero from me,60,positive,positive

product arrived quickly and in basic minimal packaging which is what i prefer seems to be a little sturdier than the element being replaced which was the first replacement after the original failed replacing the element is fairly straightforward and i would rate as easy in the homeimprovement difficulty scale just search for and follow the multiple videos available for stepbystep instructionsbr br hoping this lasts a little longer than the burned out element that this is replacing it was nice to receive a backup thermostat and thermal fuse for the same price as the element alone,60,positive,positive
i am unable to review for a working piece this is the second broken one i have received so my dryer is still down third time is is a charm right,60,positive,positive
these filters were too big for the pods that came with them,60,positive,positive
bought these to free up serving table space at thanksgiving and make transport easier could not be happier well made and instead of taking up valuable space with  or more deviled egg serving platters we can stack all  of these and have four dozen deviled eggs ready to serve in about half the table space of one platter the trays and lids snap together easily and securely and come apart with minimal effort love them,60,positive,positive

the product was easy enough to figure out how to use and the coffee tasted great till i reached the end of the cup i dont know if the coffee i had bought was too finely ground but a large settlement of coffee with the texture of dust had gathered so when i reached the end i got a mouth full of gritty and thick coffee like sludge i have bought filters to put in so i will test that out when they get here,60,positive,positive
this vent does not have sufficient suction to pull exhaust through the filter it just swirls around under the unit,60,positive,negative
this works great it protects the eggs and you can stack other items on top of the lid to save space in the fridge,60,positive,positive
as others have said this sort of fits as a replacement filter but the water is not actually being filtered and still tastes and smells of chlorine and impurities unfortunately i waited until after the return window to attempt to install it,60,positive,negative

during the epidemic many friends around me bought small washing machines i thought about it a little but i was worried that i couldnt put it down so i gave up the idea recently my daughters skin is itchy from time to time  so my friend suggested me to buy one too after all the washing machine outside is really not clean especially for my daughters sensitive skin so i have been looking for one that is suitable for our family and the price is reasonable after deleting and selecting i finally chose  this doubletub washing machine is very suitable for rental houses it is easy to move and wash clothes the bucket is bigger than i thought the picture shows the clothes of my two children for a week i can put more clothes in summer enough for  it is used by a small family you can put as much water as you want i can finally wash it with hot water personally i feel that it is cleaner to wash with hot water and the outside is cold the twist on the left is the washing time you can choose by yourself and the middle one is for drainage  yes the time on the right is that it only takes five minutes to dry the basic clothes of course there is also the imperfection that the drying bucket is too small and it takes several times to complete the laundry once and if the drying is done  when it comes to clothes the laundry tub next to it must have water otherwise the shaking will be more severe the most important thing is that i hope this new partner can solve the problem of my daughters skin thats very grateful,60,positive,positive

this product was a perfect match very simple to install just make sure you use a multimeter and check the other components of your dryer because my thermal fuse went out due to the timer switch frying i replaced both parts and it works as good as new,60,positive,positive
we purchased this hood based on specs design price the looks are good design could be more sturdy but does the job it sucks really well however the first one arrived very damaged we got replacement for it and the second one arrived a little damaged i made it work and it looks ok but you can see some slight damage if you really pay attention the metal could be thicker gauge and it would be better its very flexible so overall i dont think i would buy it again because of construction and packaging even though the looks are great and mechanically it sucks really well it was been in use for over  months now and no issues,60,positive,positive

worked well for my situation the dryer is pushed against the same wall the vent in the wall is and the vent on the dryer was about  off center from it i did as some other reviewers and slide adjusted the periscope to the proper length and marked it with a sharpie then i trimmed the excess metal from the ends and sealed the sides with metal tape not duct tape as it will melt tricky to get it on as the dryer has to be in place not like with a flexible hose where you can hook it up and push the dryer in position asinbdyixfi m silver foil tape   x  yd  mil,60,positive,positive

this is a very low quality product i received it january th  and installed it a few days later used the dryer about twice a week and the heater element failed june th  thats less than  months of very low usebr br dear manufacturer and seller it is really not difficult to build a heater coil the issue here is that the manufacturer of this supposedly made in usa product cut corners and used  a low quality resistance wire that seems to have a rather large linear expansion coefficient in contrast to what it should be this is immediately evident from the bulging of the coils see yellow arrows and annotation in my photograph they should be straight and clearly separated from each other  the ceramic insulators are low quality junk as evident from the two broken in half ones that i marked with red arrows in the picture and  the resistant wire is made out of a cheap alloy as evident from the overall black discoloration even in undamaged areas maybe high carbon contentbr br if this is truly made in usa quality i am surprised that the manufacturer has not yet understood that quality is what keeps companies in business this level of junk quality can be purchased overseas at a fraction of the price most likely though this is amazon not monitoring sellers that are misrepresenting a product actually manufactured overseas with lowquality materialsbr br just another experience reinforcing customers decisions not to order off amazon with no warranties whatsoever,60,positive,negative
can i give  stars like many others the whole system died at  years and  month  if you buy lg products buy a warranty weve been without a fridge for  weeks now waiting for a replacement under the warranty we bought other than they dont last its a nice fridge lol,60,positive,positive

works exactly as advertised  the reason we went with this particular model is that it will actually keep the ice in the unit others you had to remove the ice and put into your freezer  we were having issues with our freezer and although we have a secondary freezer we did not want to waste space with ice traysbr br the first thing to know is that when you receive the unit you need to find a spot that level for it to sit  then wait  hours before plugging in  the cycle takes the exact time the manufacturer says  the ice is a little on the wet side so if you transfer it to a freezer just be aware that you will need to break the ice apart a little  this might be because right now our weather is in the high s approaching  so as it gets cooler this may not be an issue  i will update when the weather breaks on this issue  the manufacturer says that the ice will keep up to  hours depending on ambient temperature  so far it has been keeping fine our temp in the house is running about  so i think it does well  my only complaint is that i wish it would hold a little more ice but it automatically generates more ice as you use it so this is a pretty minor issuebr br i would recommend to anyone looking for a secondary ice source or needs a portable ice maker  great product,60,positive,positive
my mistake was expecting this to be useful for a top load washer  the zipper is for front load only  the dimensions are not as stated  the stitching was shoddy,60,positive,positive

this motor was a perfect oem replacement for my kitchenaid dishwasher you can actually leave the whole bottom subassembly intact and remove the defective motor by turning it a quarter turn you can then remove the new motor from the impeller housing using a quarter turn and just replace it in the assembly that way you do not have to worry about recrimping the clamps,60,positive,positive

i have a kenmore fridge i bought from sears several years back  ive been using their filters since then  part number cls  when i saw this come up i jumped on it  i was a bit concerned because i couldnt  confirm it was a valid replacement  rolled the dice and it fit perfectly  works greatbr br havent had it in there for a full six month cycle so far but from what ive experienced so far it seems to function just the same as the official filter from searskenmore at about half the pricebr br the water doesnt taste any different than with the official filter so ill call this a winbr br the only possible negative and its a small thing is that when you first put the filter in you have to run a few containers of water live to work all the air out of the system  it took a little more of that for this filter vs the official one  whether thats down to the individual filter i put in my fridge or the design itself i cant be sure  but once you get past that its a non issue  just thought id mention itbr br hopefully amazon continues to make these  some of the basics branded items have short shelf lives and are discontinued,60,positive,positive
they are good quality for the price,60,positive,positive

i purchased this ice maker because the one in my cu ft fridge died the cost of fixing or replacing it far exceeded the cost of this device this ice maker pumps out ice every  minutes its simple to use  you have a choice of large or small dome shaped ice i prefer large not too noisy  i check my supply of ice daily and make a fresh batch as needed if you had this running continuously youd have plenty of ice for a busy family if you have a separate freezer you could make plenty in advance of holiday parties im pleased with this purchase thus far,60,positive,positive

this is a good automatic washing machine  my house is rented and the owner does not install a washing machine and dryer in the house  they are all taken to the laundry outside  children often have to change clothes at home  its not convenient to take it out every day to wash  i bought this here  the amount of water can be adjusted according to how much clothes  the maximum amount of water is l  the washing time can also be adjusted according to the selected mode  convenient a lot  because of the capacity problem it is not suitable for washing a large number of large and thick clothes at a time but it is suitable for my family suitable for childrens clothes shirts shirts etc simple thin clothes i made a pad with wheels for it it works well  hope this helps everyone,60,positive,positive
nothing,60,positive,positive
hard to resist the lower cost of the black version offered by so many other sellers which appears to be taller and perhaps a bit smaller diameter than the original but based on other reviews i went ahead and spent the money on this one  it was a perfect fit and after three weeks and numerous wash cycles it appears to be doing the job as designed  mine was installed in a vintage kitchenaid  hard to believe how quickly the oem version gave up and started leaking  hopefully this one will be much betterbr br update  after  months still working great  a friend with a different makemodel machine took my recommendation and installed the same on a month ago and is pleased with the results,60,positive,positive
i dont like the fact that the video shows the top with the foil on it as being recycleable its not because even if you peel off the aluminum foil by hand it will still have paper filter stuck to the inside rim i spoke to the woman at medelco and she said only the cup part is recycleable so the video is misleading also the blades could be a bit longer to cut through the paper filter as it is the filter with grounds is firmly attached to the top with the foil its messy to separate it by hand lastly the blades wear out quickly and dont seem to be replaceable,60,positive,positive
pay attention to part number this fits perfectly just make sure you run the water for a minute or  before actually drinking,60,positive,positive

ive been using it for over a month  love everything about this little machine  the videos on youtube were very helpful  a couple of things to pass alongthere are no wheels on this model so i put it on a small utility cart but it is light enough to move without one just awkward  some wash settings can take over an hour so i use quick wash cleans great  minutes or standard  minutes  i roll it into my kitchen attach it to the faucet  it drains  pumps out into my kitchen sink  it does a great job spinning the water out of the clothes etc  last thingthey do test some of the machines prior to shipping like mine so it had some droplets on it  kind of a funky smell from shipping out not completely drained  that went away after i ran an empty wash cycle  i use liquid soap  put it on the bottom before loading  theres a slot for fabric softener  very happy i picked this little washer,60,positive,positive
i live in a rental with a very old ge gas range the oven knob was missing numbers but still usable until i took it off to clean it i ended up with no numbers at all so i ordered these to replace them all no need to have mismatched knobs no matter how old the range anyway it took some figuring out to get the knobs lined up properly and i had to use the grey insert for some and the black insert for others but they fit and they work and thats all that really matters to me to get them lined up i put the insert on partially then put the knob on pulled them off together then pushed the insert in as fr as it would go and presto they are lined up perfectly,60,positive,positive

we previously had the ivation ivaicemsil ice maker and it served us for two years of continuous operation before eventually suffering a mechanical failure that i was unable to fix instead of buying another ivation i went with this costway model hoping that it would be easier to clean than the ivation was see in that ice maker the whole upperrear area where the ice cubes are formed was really gross and basically impossible to clean i couldnt get any rags or brushes back there to wipe it so there was always this gross red film in certain areas of the machines insidesbr br well i was very surprised to find that this costway machine is nearly identical to the ivation not only in size and features but also the problematic icemaking area the only real difference between the two models is that the ivations controls are on the back of the main unit whereas the costways controls are on the lid everything else is the same i dont know whos ripping off whom here but its kinda crazy i took sidebyside pics of the two ice makers the broken ivations on the left,60,positive,positive

the dryer constantly stops and starts a few minutes into a cycle i have made sure that the vent is clear and that all the filters are clean even then after running on medium heat for two minutes the dryer shuts off for a minute then runs for another minute or so and then shuts off again i also noticed that the dryer pulls over  watts every time it starts up again for a bout five seconds that cannot be good for the any of the wiring either i have tried two other panda dryers and none of them have these issues,60,positive,positive

this little alcohol burner nests very nicely into my solo stove kit and works wonderfully when im too lazy to gather twigs for a fire it isnt amazingly lightweight but the upside is it would be very hard to damage this alcohol burner works very well for heating water i on average can get  oz of water boiling in  minutes so long as the wind isnt bad and still have plenty of alcohol left to burn,60,positive,positive

let me first say i did not buy this item through amazon  i dont want to give amazon a bad name  in total honesty i purchased this item at a local thrift store for only   i had been wanting a counter top ice maker for a couple of years but didnt want to pay the higher prices without knowing exactly what i was going to get  you know is it too large  does it take up more counter space then imagined  does it make enough ice  those type of questions  so imagine my delight when i found it for only   well know i can say i know the reason why the previous owner got rid of it  well i can say it got me through the summer months and then one night i was awaken by the loud screeching and scraping noise coming from the machine  before i laid down it was working great but all of a sudden it just went crazy  after investigating i noticed the basket that catches the water was cracked  it would catch the water but not make the ice  even though the coils would frost up but it just would never actually complete the job of making the ice  then it would go through the motions of filling the basket with water and all the loud screeching and scraping it just not make the ice  i guess for the money i paid for it i could have rated it higher but like i said i see why the previous owner donated it to the thrift store,60,positive,negative

the grinding teeth started flying out of the basin and shattered the light above the sink if one of us had been looking over the drain at that moment the shrapnel would have sliced through a main artery and splattered blood across the kitchen and filled our children with lifelong trauma did stephen king design this piece of crap oh and it hasnt drained since the plumbers working for our worldclass contractor naylor construction installed the dumb thing  when we asked repeatedly about this issue they simply claimed thats how all new sinks worked  uh huh we fell for it so i guess shame on us  humanity is doomedits no wonder mama nature is trying to eradicate us with her homemade antibodies aka virusesbr ps  thats ketchup in the picture used for effect  they werent honest in their presentation of the product so quid pro quo clarice quid pro quo,60,positive,positive
to be fair this thing did a great job at washing the dishs for a little over  yr  then i started getting the dreaded e error code  look it up  overflow sensor  took the unit out of the cabinet found a little water in the over flow sensors double checked my drain was flowing well  then it worked for like  cycles and i would get the code again  intermitent it would run a cycle then e since jan this year  i finally called out a service co from their list on the danby website the determined a slight crack in the sump housing was causing the leak hence the error code  parts and labor were going to be almost  to fix it  which is pretty much what i paid for it off the wallmart website  there are not many choices in these narrorw units  very few  yes this was the most affordable i could find as the big names were  plus  i contacted danby and of course being out of warrantee nothing they could do but offered a rebate on another danby purchse  this was my first experience with this brand  and owning many diswashers in my life this one is the shortest lived of any of them  i dont think i will ever be looking at this brand again  bit the bullet and replaced it with a bosch   hopefully it will last longer  yes the danby cleaned really nice looked attractive and was pretty quiet  just didnt last and was a fortune to repair  lets keep filling up our landfills with energy rated appliances that dont last lol,60,positive,positive

i would have given this  stars after first use love the idea of eliminating the use of kcups and have something reusable to help the environment however just barely a month of nondaily use two of them are already deteriorating for the lack of a better term though i drink a cup of coffee daily i ordered a set of  and rotate between them religiously so it is not like these two are getting overused needless to say the two in the picture have to be thrown away as they are causing a mess within kcup holder and all over my kitchen counter it is disappointing would definitely recommend and look for a better quality alternative,60,positive,positive

for nearly  years ive had my lgkenmore fridge and every time i go to replace the water filter i seek out one that actually removes things like lead and other toxins not just make the water smell better  i end up having to come back to the oem filter ltp which seems to have such capability  all the buy  for the same price as the oem lack the  and other certifications against the really bad stuff  also knowing this truly is not made in china rather made in the us provides just a bit more confidence in the product  it is also reasonably priced nearly  the cost of the oem and for several years keep reading too many reviews speculating about counterfeit oem filters  in summary it installed easily my water has no smell and the water tastes super clean  looks like my nobrainer goto brand moving forward,60,positive,positive

after a good many years of service one of the knobs right front burner broke off i think it was leaned on reaching a cabinet above  it failed in the usual way having broken off the center stud that mounts on the burner control shaft  these are a plastic stud with a metal insert that is fashioned so as to add a gripping arrangement to hold it on the shaft  the outside plastic has no reinforcement and so a side force on the knob can and usually does break it off  these new knobs have a steel sleeve on the outside  to add reinforcement to the stud and help prevent the fracturing  the same thing used to happen on the old radio control knobs and i used brass tubing from my model railroading supplies to fix them  worked then and works now  this is a set of high quality knobs that were only twice the price for one of amazons choices no brainer replace all five as new and keep the old as spares if you like,60,positive,positive
inexplicably amazon just sends this in a plastic bag not a box  as such the filters gets crushed and damaged  still usable but certainly not optimal  others have offered the same feedback  otherwise this is fine slips right in  note that they do come with this whitish residue on the filter  that is normal,60,positive,negative

crevice into  in falling from debris keeps,60,positive,positive
it fits fine but tends to spray water everywhere especially if it hasnt been used for a couple of hours,60,positive,positive
this came rolled up  it does not stay flat  i will upload a picture but ultimately it feels cheap it doesnt stay flat and it would probably work better if the stove top were flat and the counter was exactly flush with the stove  it will help keep things from falling in the space between the stove and counter but it is also going to catch crumbs under it because of its inability to stay firmly in place  disappointed but better than nothing and i guess you get what you pay for,60,positive,negative

i installed it late may  it went in easily and i first noticed that the lid latch barely held the lid shut after you put the soap in the original lid latch seemed to be spring loaded the last few weeks you had to close the lid and hold it shut with one hand and then use you other hand and swing the lid latch shut last night i ran the dishwasher and now the lid did not open at all during the rinse cycle  the half melted soap tab was still in there with soapy water  i also noticed that the rinse aid does not seem to be dispensing i filled that many weeks ago and it is still showing full i replaced the original dispenser because it was leaking rinse aid everything else works great now this new one does not leak at all but just the other above problems,60,positive,negative
the exact one,60,positive,positive
i recently moved to a new place and had to change the water filter in the fridge i have a tds total dissolved solids reader so i tested the tap water and o had readings anywhere between  which is very high so i placed my new filter in the fridge i let it run and i dumped about  gallons i then tested the water from my fridge after placing the filter and still got a reading of  the readings would be around s when i would initially get water from the fridge and then come down to the s after taking out a couple of cups either way it seems like its doing nothing or at least close to nothing i just spent money for no reason it seems,60,positive,negative

very nice modern looking hood with an excellent fairly quite fan that does the job i didnt have much trouble installing it either it went up quickly one caveat for anyone with  or  foot ceilings i have  foot ceilings and in order for the decorative flue to reach the ceiling i had to mount the range hood no closer than  from the stove top i was aware of this before purchasing the hood from reading the online installation manual and i was fine with this  however and not stated in the manual unless mounted at least  above the stove the louvers that are there for the nonducted application will show the directions tell you to reverse the top portion so the louvers are hidden they are not if you do reverse the top section the louvers are in the middle of the flue which looks stupid the solution of course is to buy the extension for  ceilings this is another  and it is a complete replacement for the standard flue not just a longer top piece broan needs to give the customer the option when buying the range hood which flue they need not force them to buy the optional one and throw away the  original as it is useless they also need to state in their manual that the louvers may show for  ceilings with the standard flue depending on mounting height,60,positive,negative
it lasted less than a year before it burned out,60,positive,negative

i was really looking for an count egg holder but i settled for this count design i say settled but turns out it was the best one to get because it allows for most of two cartons to be stored in the space of a little over one very heavy duty wipe clean and the lid fits well not tight but snugly so it doesnt slide or rattle great purchase,60,positive,positive
the part that attaches to the sink started to leak really bad so i had to replace it this is an official ge part it was very easy to replace the old unicouple and now my dish washer works again the price that i paid for it was much more reasonable than the  that ge was charging on their website its just a couple of hoses with some simple attachments on the end it shouldnt cost that muchbr br if you are looking for new unicouple for your dishwasher then deciding to purchase this is a no brainer,60,positive,positive

edit the seller contacted me within a day after my review asked for videos of the washer to see if we could somehow fix it we were unable to do so and they are now helping me solve my problem they sent out a replacement due to be here in  days so so far i have had excellent customer service i will update again once i receive the replacementbr br i loved this washer it is perfect for my townhouse unfortunately it started making a burning wire smell so i turned it off and hand rung my clothes i tried to use it again a few days later and it isnt working  very let down because ive only had it for a couple of months i bought this so i wont have to go to the laundry mat so often due to covid  also i would like to note i researched tips and tricks for these kinds of washers i spent quite a few hours and multiple days doing so i really babied this thing i never overloaded it took hours long breaks in between loads so im pretty disappointed i have  kids and im a single momma im trying my best to not go into public so they dont contract the virus but now i have the option to either hand wash all these clothes or go to the laundry mat,60,positive,positive

first time using it omg i am more than pleased with this little dryer i have been using a combo washerdryer for the past  years and never ever had completely dry clothes when the the dryer function ended even after running for hours on end i put in a heavy egyptian bath towel and  hand towels towels came out bone dry in half the time i set the timer for one of my coworkers set it up yesterday in less than an hour and vented it so it goes out the bedroom window see picture so no heating up the house its warm enough here in florida but like i said today was the first time using it so keeping my fingers crossed it continues to work this well just had one small issue though there is a slight dent on the one side but it does not seem to affect the dryer functioning at all dont know if it came from the mfg that way or was damaged during shipping there was a hole in the side of the box so it looks like i wont be spending my entire weekends doing laundry anymore,60,positive,negative

i had been neglecting my keurig and the taste of the coffee reminded me  i only drink  cups a day and im picky about the quality and taste of those two cups  i ordered this descaler and went through the cycle of brewing hot water and brewing and brewing some more  very time consuming but necessary  and when i made my next cup of coffee it was all worth the time  the excellent flavor had returned and i was a very happy coffee snob i have now marked on the bottle the date i used the descaler so that i can keep track of when i need to do this againand i wont wait over a year to do so  great product i totally recommend it,60,positive,positive

this samsung refrig water filter has many positives produces clean goodtasting water from the getgo fairly easy to install doesnt leak assuming its installed properly and is moderately priced  the biggest negative is that it seems real slow in dispensing water perhaps that is due to the highly effective filtering process  if so its a reasonable tradeoff  i have been using these in our samsung refrigerator for slightly over a year and on average they last  months before needing a replacement  can be found on amazon and other online vendors much less expensively than brick  mortar retailers  highly recommended,60,positive,positive

this part was used to replace an existing part in a  year old kenmore washer that would not go into a rinsedrain cycle  the part sends a signal to the electronics which begins the rinsedrain cycle and eventually spins  the signal insures the door is locked closed before the spin begins  the part took care of the problem and it made for a good opportunity to do some other preventive maintenance on the washer  the washer is working very well now,60,positive,positive

when we replaced our washer and dryer units i had to work hard get what i wanted  exceeding my husband expectations of cost was the difficult part but it turns out the whirlpool duet front loader washer ghw and matching dryer gew was a great investment  without being a slave to the laundry room i can get six large loads done in a day  being energy star certified the duet units are extremely efficiently even with large loads  and the washer conserves water by automatically adjusting how much is needed for each loadbr br but the decision was not an easy one as some reviews about front loaders discussed concerns of mildew and extreme entanglement of clothing  by actually read the manuals since our purchase april  we havent had a single problem or complaintbr br every day reasons to love thembr br  quietbr br  quickbr br  easily cleansdries large loadsbr br  from delicate to heavy duty you are in controlbr br green reasons to love thembr br  uses half the water needed by top loadersbr br  uses half the energy of traditional units,60,positive,positive

i ordered the pack of waterdrop water filters an advertised replacement for the samsung filter dag for two reasons  the first was that the filters are roughly onefourth the price of the samsung filters  the second was the very positive reviews  we purchased our home six months ago and the appliances stayed one of which was the samsung refrigerator  we have not had a waterice dispenser previously thus the idea of a water filter in a refrigerator was something new  i was pretty shocked when i discovered the price of a new filter by samsung was   i did some research online and decided on the waterdrop in spite of the manufacturers admonition to use only samsung filters  if samsung wants this they need to price their filters much more competitively  i installed one of the new filters today  it was quite easy  the only thing that was perplexing to me was direction step   locate the start arrow found at the top of the instruction label on the back side of the filter  i could not find this but had no problems with installation anyway  in a nutshell  filter works well costs onefourth the price,60,positive,positive

most importantly it makes good coffee unfortunately a few design issues first off very noisy with various sound effects  also if you take the water tank off of the machine to fill or clean it it is very awkward to put it back on especially full of water there is a slideguide in the center of the tank and on the machine that need to be aligned to seat the tank properly this seems unnecessarily is difficult better to use a pitcher to fill it,60,positive,positive

sadly we purchased this wonderful refrigerator  thrilled with all three sectionslove the storage howeverbr br the icemaker has a mind of its own it shoots out ice unexpectedly after using it it clogs and then no ice comes out when you least expect it  it was quite an investment  no recalls i checked  i was so happy to have the three sections but i am so disappointed  very noisy icemaker tooin the middle of the night it scares me  cubes will dump into the channel very loudly i still like the refrig part just sad about the ice maker,60,positive,positive

we just completed a kitchen remodel which included all new appliances one of which is a samsung electric rangeoven in all fairness we are accustomed to and prefer gas however in our current home gas is not an option  in my research silicone can withstand up to f i was cleaning the counter top and leaned over the range to reach the backsplash when apparently i pushed in the burner control which turned on the front burner on the range a flaw in the samsung range for sure in less than  seconds i smelled the melting of the protective cover and immediately pulled it off and rushed to our balcony with it as the back dripped on the floor i doubt the burner reached f before i pulled the cover off the reason i offer this experience albeit my fault to a large degree no pun intended is that the product if subjected to very much heat may cause damage to the appliance surface andor worse i gave the product  stars for ease of installation and being easy to clean and  star for resistance to heat since the bad outcome was user error i have not requested any action by the vendor nor will i this is intended to provide information to potential buyers only the first picture is the back side which i added gorilla tape to cover the wound the second picture shows the holes caused by the heat on the top side,60,positive,negative
